# Personal site built on ox-hugo and deployed by Nix

## Reference Implementation
[ox-hugo-nix](https://codeberg.org/shom/ox-hugo-nix), the reference implementation I wish I had when this repo started.

## Structure
This site and tooling grew with me as I learned a lot of this tech stack so this isn't how I'd encourage anyone else to do it if I were starting today, that's what I created the reference implementation.

## Running locally
- For local build run `./container/nix-container.sh`
- For local development with live reload run `./container/nix-local.sh`
