A list of guides to answer the question "How do I start ______?"
#+end_description

Sometimes it's hard to get started with something new. Sure there are so many resources, almost too many resources, distilling just the essential information is difficult. Here I'm collecting the things I've learned over time, so if I were starting from scratch today, I could just jump in and get started.

These are not blog posts fixed in time so if something changes I hope to change the information inline without clarifying edits.
