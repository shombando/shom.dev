description: "Color photo of life size bronze sculptures in front of a black brick facade with a black door on the right end of the frame. The five figures are facing towards the door, they're all of different heights but dressed similarly in long trench coats and slight variations of a trilby style hats. The expressions of the statues are gaunt, most have their hands in their coat pockets the one in the front of the line has his arms crossed. The bronze statues have the greenish patina except for the shoulders and sleeves where people have touched them, almost as if in support for their plight as if lending strength to them to stay standing in the bread line despite the inclement times and weather. The writing above is mostly cutoff except for the word 'NOURISH'."
