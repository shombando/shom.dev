description: "Black and white photo taken from indoors looking at a door what is mostly in shadow but the frame and doorknob can be made out. The door has a 9 pane window and the scene outside is of that of a small pond with some trees on the far end with fields extending beyond under an empty sky. Most of the pond is in the bottom third, the trees in the middle third, and the top third is completely void of features."
