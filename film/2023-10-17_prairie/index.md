description: Black and white image showing a tall stalks of grass with beads of dew on them. Most stalks are vertical except one gone across the middle. A few of the stalks have seeding tops weighted down by the moisture, the background is out of focus in a pleasant blur which blown-out highlights in the sky forming some bokeh bubbles.
