description: "Black and white photo of three sky scrapers with glass window facades are lined up with two on the left closer together and the right one with more a gap with the middle building. Each building a different take on rectangle, from left to right: stacked rectangles with triangle shapes sticking out the top, proper rectangles with square segments, rectangle exterior windows facade broken up with recessed rectangles angling down. The top right of the photo has leafless tree branches encroaching towards the top of the buildings."
