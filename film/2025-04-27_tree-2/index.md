description: "A massive tree planting mechanized spade is on the back of a truck with a tree loaded in the spade. There is a person's head and shoulder wearing a baseball cap in the bottom right, which clues in the scale of the spade to be about 10ft tall from tip of the blade to the top of the pivot arm and about the 15 ft in diameter."
