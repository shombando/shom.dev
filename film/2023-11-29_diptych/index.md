description: Black & white diptych of a giant sculpture of a 60's era astronaut figure with a rocket cone shaped helped holding a rocket with both hands.  The rocket says "Launching Pad" and the pedestal of the statue says "Gemini Giant". The left photo is the full figure with a tree in the immediate background and houses in the far background, giving the statue a sense of scale (about two stories tall). The right image is a close up of the helmeted face and the back of the rocket which shows an USA flag.
