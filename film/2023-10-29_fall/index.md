description: The whole frame is full of foliage and dominated by a tree with big branches covered in yellow leaves backlit by the sun and little bits of blue sky can be made out through the thicket. There's an underexposed tree with green leaves to the left and some spindly green growth near the bottom of the frame with a barely visible edge of walking path.
